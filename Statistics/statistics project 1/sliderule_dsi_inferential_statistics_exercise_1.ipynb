    "## What is the true normal human body temperature? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. In 1992, this value was revised to 36.8$^{\\circ}$C or 98.2$^{\\circ}$F. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? \n",
    "    - Remember that this is a condition for the CLT, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply. \n",
    "2.  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?\n",
    "    - Bring out the one sample hypothesis test! In this situation, is it approriate to apply a z-test or a t-test? How will the result be different?\n",
    "3.  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be \"abnormal\"?\n",
    "    - Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval.\n",
    "4.  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?\n",
    "    - Set up and solve for a two sample hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
